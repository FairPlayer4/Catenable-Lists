# Catenable-Lists
A Java implementation of purely functional Catenable Lists including adapted Haskell source from Okasaki

This repository contains code from the book Purely Functional Data Structures by Chris Okasaki.
In particular the Haskell implementation of Catenable Lists (queues that support efficient concatenation) and some related data structures. 

The code will adapted to be used for examples and various examples are included.

Also a Java implementation of Catenable Lists is included. The Java implementation is not as "clean" as the Haskell implementation and mainly for demonstration purposes for people who are not as familiar with functional programming languages.

The Java implementation will also include examples and performance comparison with StringBuilder and general String concatenation.
